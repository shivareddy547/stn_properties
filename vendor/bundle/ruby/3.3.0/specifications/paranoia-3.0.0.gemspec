You would use either plugin / gem if you\n    wished that when you called destroy on an Active Record object that it\n    didn't actually destroy it, but just \"hid\" the record. Paranoia does this\n    by setting a deleted_at field to the current time when you destroy a record,\n    and hides it by scoping all queries on your model to only include records\n    which do not have a deleted_at field.\n".freeze
